# Puannhi - An asynchronous time-variant feedback delay networks reverberation

Shoutout to Professor Sebastian J. Schlecht! 

Whenever my colleagues or music-friends ask how I created such a cool effect, I tell them that I met the "God of Reverb" and drew the most of inspiration from this paper: 
> Schlecht, Sebastian J and Habets, EmanuÃ«l A P, *Time-varying feedback matrices in feedback delay networks and their application in artificial reverberation*, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 2015.
